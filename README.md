🚀 **Code-Your-ML: Learn Machine Learning from Scratch**

Code-Your-ML is a hands-on learning repository designed to help you understand machine learning by writing the code yourself. Instead of abstract theories alone, you’ll dive directly into beginner-friendly projects with step-by-step explanations and practical implementations.

Our mission is simple: to demystify machine learning by showing you what really happens under the hood.

**📌 How It Works**

A new ML concept + coding project will be uploaded every 4 days.

This pacing ensures you have enough time to learn, practice, and internalize each concept.

By following along consistently, you’ll gradually build a solid foundation in ML — one project at a time.

This is not a sprint. It’s a structured learning journey that rewards persistence and practice.

**📂 What You’ll Find Here**

✅ Focused Projects – Each project covers one key ML concept at a time.

✅ Clear Explanations – Theory is explained in simple, beginner-friendly language.


✅ Practical Code – Every line is well-commented so you can follow the logic step by step.

**🎯 Who Is This For?**

This repository is designed for:

Beginners curious about machine learning.

Students who prefer hands-on coding instead of just reading theory.

Anyone who wants to understand how ML actually works behind the scenes.

**🛠️ Getting Started**

1.Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Code-Your-ML.git
    cd Code-Your-ML

2.Follow the projects in sequence (start from Day 1).

3.Run the code, experiment, and tweak to deepen your understanding.

**🌱 Contributing**

Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome!
If you’d like to improve explanations, add more examples, or suggest a new project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

**📢 Final Note**

Machine learning can seem intimidating at first, but with consistent practice, it becomes intuitive.
Code-Your-ML is here to make that journey approachable, structured, and fun.
